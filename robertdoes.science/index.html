	<div class="sectionheader">> Why study ageing?</div>
	Because it is both challenging and absolutely fascinating.<br>
	Ageing is a catch-all for all the things that will break in the human body given enough time, often connected to age-related diseases such as cancer, diabetes, and Alzheimer's disease. Each a complex problem in its own right, they are also interconnected in complicated ways. This makes them a perfect fit for computational approaches designed to wrangle meaning from complex and noisy data.<br><br>

	<div class="sectionheader">> What have you worked on?</div>
	I have analysed and interpreted high throughput biological data to investigate the tissue-specific insulin response in mutant flies, highlighting specific metabolic responses that make them live longer. More recently, I have worked with RNAseq data from mouse embryonic stem cell (mESC) lines, teasing apart regulatory networks of self-renewal (paper in preparation).

	<div class="sectionheader">> Web apps using R Shiny</div>

	This server was set up to tinker with the <a target="_blank" href="https://shiny.rstudio.com/">shiny web framework</a> for R. As part of the ongoing project investigating self-renewal of mESC's, I have build an app that allows interactive exploration of data and results. In the meantime, I will host some smaller apps here:

	<br><br>
	
	<a href="http://shiny.robertdoes.science/cellplot" target="_blank">[CellPlot]</a> generates segmented bar charts. These visualize functional term enrichments (e.g. from the gene ontology analysis of a gene set), and simultaneously the relative changes of individual genes between experimental conditions.

	<br><br>

	<a href="http://shiny.robertdoes.science/shinySETGO" target="_blank">[shinySETGO]</a> determines if a geneset of interest is enriched in known biological functions (gene ontology terms). Redundancy is reduced by clustering terms that contain the same subsets of genes. I wrote the underlying script to simplify these standard analyses in my own projects. Implementing the web app served as a refresher in mySQL.
